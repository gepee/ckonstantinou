Flexibility Optimization Tool
Overview
The Flexibility Optimization Tool is a software application designed to solve the LI/MILP problem for flexibility optimization in energy systems. It optimizes the scheduling of flexible resources, such as battery energy storage systems (BESSs) and distributed energy resources (DGs), to meet given energy demand while minimizing operating costs or maximizing profits. And it reflects the results on the flexmeasures software. 
Problem Statement
The optimization problem aims to schedule the operation of flexible resources based on dynamic price signals, such as real-time prices (RTP) or time-of-use tariffs. The objective is to optimize the allocation of resources to minimize operating costs or maximize profits while meeting energy demand. In this scenario, we are considering a system in which there a load (building), a solar PV, a wind generation, distributed generator and a energy storage system device. The following are the parameters considered of the following:
Name of source/load	Rating 
ESS	0.5 MW
Wind Turbine	0.5 MW
Solar	0.5 MW
Residential  colony	20 MW
DG	0.5 MW








We assumes that, Solar, wind, residential building forecasted day ahead data is available and we need to schedule our ESS and DG resources accordingly for max profit for consumers with reference to given dynamic pricing. In this case the pricing is assumed to similar to load consumption of residential building. We have considered positive for consumption, negative for production.
